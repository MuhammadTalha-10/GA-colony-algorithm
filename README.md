# Combined Genetic and Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of a combined algorithm that integrates genetic algorithms and ant colony optimization. The algorithm combines the strengths of both approaches to tackle optimization problems and potentially achieve improved results.

## Overview

The combined algorithm utilizes the genetic algorithm's exploration capability and the ant colony optimization's exploitation capability to efficiently search for optimal or near-optimal solutions in the problem space. It incorporates genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation, along with the pheromone-based solution construction and update mechanisms of ant colony optimization.

## Features

- Integration of genetic algorithms and ant colony optimization.
- Genetic algorithm components: population, selection, crossover, and mutation.
- Ant colony optimization components: pheromone matrix, solution construction, and pheromone update.
- Fitness evaluation for problem-specific objectives.
- Support for both single-objective and multi-objective optimization problems.
- Customizable parameters for fine-tuning the algorithm's behavior.
